## Description
This is a mock-up API of a social networking site. This API tracks users with a username, email, and a specific id. This information is linked with thoughts that users can post, which have a text value as well as their own id. Users may react to other user's thoughts with a reaction, that is tied to it's own text value and id. Routes are in place to search all users, users by id, create a new user, edit a user, and delete a user. Users may also add and remove friends. Routes are in place to search for all thoughts, thoughs by individual id, create a new thought, edit a thought, and delete a thought. Reactions may also be added and deleted.
